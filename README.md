## 1. Problem Statement

The world of web3 is evolving at an unprecedented rate. Yet, a profound issue remains - the chasm between ideators with transformative concepts and developers possessing the technical expertise to actualize these visions. This disconnect paves the way for lost potential, hindered innovation, and fears of idea appropriation. DevChain's mission is to bridge this divide through a platform that's secure, decentralized, and instills trust.

## 2. Project Implementation

### 2.1 Smart Contracts

Harnessing the power of the Tron blockchain, DevChain embodies its primary functions. Each project submission and developer's interest expression initiates a distinct Solidity smart contract. These contracts operate as legally binding accords, safeguarding project information from misuse. An expert committee or NLP model validates the project's legality and authenticity prior to contract establishment. Key features include:

- **Data Structures**:
  - **Project**: A representation of projects encompassing a title, owner, and list of interested developers.
  - **projects**: A catalogue of all submitted projects.
  - **developers**: A map connecting developer addresses to their expressed interest status.

- **Core Functions**:
  - **postProject**: Enables users to introduce a new project.
  - **expressInterest**: Facilitates developers in signaling interest for specific projects.
  - **viewProject**: Allows interested developers to delve into project specifics.

### 2.2 User Experience

At the heart of DevChain lies an intuitive and engaging user interface. Ideators can seamlessly present projects, evaluate developer portfolios, and kick-start collaborations. Developers have the liberty to delve into project specifics, signal interest, and await ideator validation.
